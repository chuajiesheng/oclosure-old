   * Class goog.ui.Control
   *
   * Base class for UI controls. Extends goog.ui.Component by adding the 
   * following:
   *  - a goog.events.KeyHandler, to simplify keyboard handling,
   *  - a pluggable renderer framework, to simplify the creation of simple 
   *    controls without the need to subclass this class,
   *  - the notion of component content, like a text caption or DOM structure 
   *    displayed in the component (e.g. a button label),
   *  - getter and setter for component content, as well as a getter and setter
   *    specifically for caption text (for convenience),
   *  - support for hiding/showing the component,
   *  - fine-grained control over supported states and state transition events,
   *    and
   *  - default mouse and keyboard event handling. 
   *
   * This class has sufficient built-in functionality for most simple UI 
   * controls. All controls dispatch SHOW, HIDE, ENTER, LEAVE, and ACTION events
   * on show, hide, mouseover, mouseout, and user action, respectively. 
   * Additional states are also supported. See closure/demos/control.html for 
   * example usage.
