    * OClosure Project - 2010
    * Class goog.asserts.AssertionError
    *
    * This implements the EventTarget interface as defined by W3C DOM 2/3. 
    * The main difference from the spec is that
    * the this does not know about event
    * propagation and therefore the flag whether to use bubbling or capturing 
    * is not used. 
    * Another difference is that event objects do not really have to implement 
    * the Event interface. 
    * An object is treated as an event object if it has a type property. 
    * It also allows you to pass a string instead of an event object and 
    * in that case an event like object is created with the type set 
    * to the string value.
    * Unless propagation is stopped, events dispatched by 
    * an EventTarget bubble to
    * its parent event target, returned by getParentEventTarget.
    * To set the parent event target, call setParentEventTarget or override 
    * getParentEventTarget in a subclass.
    * Subclasses that don't support changing the parent event target should
    * override the setter to throw an error.
